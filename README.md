Source Code for Berkeley's CS61A Ants vs SomeBees project 

The course was not taken as part of Berkeley University's curriculum but rather self-undertaken as part of a skill enhancement course.

The project is a tower defense game in which the user deploys as Ants to protect the Ant queen from attacking bees.
